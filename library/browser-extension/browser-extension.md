# Soupcan
{: .no_toc }

Soupcan is a browser extension that brings together many trans-supportive features into one package for Twitter.
For example, it highlights transphobic users in red and takes reports from the community to keep this list updated
and accurate. It allows you to hide or mask content from transphobes. In the future I plan to make features such
as auto-blocking transphobes, auto-suggesting sources to reply with trans-supportive content, and anything else
you might suggest!

1. How do I report a user as a transphobe?
  Just right click on their username or name and choose Report transphobe from the Soupcan menu.

2. How do I report someone who was unfairly marked?
  The same as above but instead click "Appeal".

## Features

1. Shows transphobic usernames in red, and on what grounds they got marked red on their profile.
2. Reports are logged and saved including reasoning so it can be reviewed at a later date.
3. Trust-based reporting system means that the reporting is community-driven and transparent, not only relying on the creator's decisions.
4. Login with Twitter is required, to help prevent abuse and to also add accountability.
5. Ability to mask out content by known transphobes
6. Ability to do content-matching on images, gifs and videos to hide sensitive content (if posted by anyone)
7. Database updates frequently and automatically without needing to update the extension
8. Bonus features: Hiding ads, preventing Zalgo text
9. And more to come!

Soon, other features will be rolled in to improve QoL and to offer more trans-supportive features. Check out the github project

## Bugs and suggestions
See the [Github issue section](https://github.com/bethylamine/soupcan/issues) for all reported issues and suggested enhancements.

## Rules for use
Please see the [Terms of Service](https://bethylamine.github.io/library/browser-extension/tos)

Additionally, if you're marked as a transphobe, or your account is too new, you won't be able to use the extension. If this
is an issue or you feel like you've been falsely marked please DM me on Twitter @bethylamine.

## Mark reasons

* **Marked in Shinigami Eyes** -- Was added manually to Soupcan from [Shinigami Eyes](https://shinigami-eyes.github.io/)
* **Detected by Shinigami Eyes** -- [Shinigami Eyes](https://shinigami-eyes.github.io/) running within Soupcan detected a user that wasn't in Soupcan
* **Reported by extension creator** -- Marked manually by @bethylamine
* **Reported by moderation team** -- Marked manually by a community moderator
* **Reported by \<X\> users** -- Got enough reports to be marked red by community, from X number of users
* **Marked by mark/markme** -- Manually marked using @WhatIsAWomanBot's `mark` (by Beth) or `markme` (by themselves) commands.
* **Marked via content \[\<X\>\]**[^1] -- Transphobic content found in their name, bio and/or tweets, with a score of X
* **Marked by hashtag usage**[^1] -- Used transphobic hashtag (in sincerity) in a tweet that got some traction
* **Marked by likes**[^1] -- Had a like pattern of transphobic tweets
* **Marked via GPT**[^1] -- Tweets relating to gender or trans issues were deemed transphobic by ChatGPT
* **Marked via TransphobeB**[^1] -- User existed on the @TransphobeB blocklist (This reason is the most likely to be false positive.)

## Why is it named 'Soupcan'?
It's a reference/homage to [VYZZE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBGYQnjxMmI) by the late transgender music producer SOPHIE. The lyrics go "Make it pop red and white, tomato soup can". Additionally, tomatoes and tomato juice/soup has been recognized as anti-gender fascist iconography after Posie Parker was famously "[juiced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1QkXFHKCtM)" at a rally she then aborted.
