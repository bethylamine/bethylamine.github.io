### 41% and other references to suicide
An often (incorrectly) cited statistic regarding transgender suicide rate. The study this statistic comes from
was looking at suicide **attempt** rates, not rates of (completed) suicide. Often used as a vehicle to
point out that trans people are mentally ill ([they're not](/library/gc-arguments/mental-illness).)

See the page on [suicide](/library/whatisawomanbot/threads/suicide) for more information.

### Autogynephilia (AGP)

The theory (proposed and really only supported by) Ray Blanchard that transgender women are attracted to the idea of
themselves as women; as a kind of paraphilia or fetish. This is a heavily criticized theory that has been heavily
debunked but still remains a staple way to pathologize trans women.

See the page on [Autogynephilia](/library/gc-arguments/agp) for debunking.

### Adult human female (AHF)
The "correct" response to ["What is a woman?"](#what-is-a-woman) that intentially positions "female" as the imperative noun
of the definition, used in this way to emphasize the [biological sex](#biological-sex) condition of womanhood.

### Biological sex
The simplistic and binary view of sex as two distinct and immutable classes defined by biology, despite
biology acknowledging the spectrum of sexual characteristics and intersex persons. The definition typically
ranges from chromosomes, to genitalia, to the less tangible "organization of development for the production of gametes".

### Conversion therapy
Based on a conspiracy theory that suggests gay children are being transitioned ("transed") as a form of
[homophobic](#homophobia) conversion therapy.

### Cuntboy
Derogatory term for trans men.

### Handmaid, handmaiden (or sex traitor)
A reference to The Handmaid's Tale that TERFs use to label women who are allies to the trans community. The essence of this
epithet is that they have shamefully given themselves up to serve the oppressor. Functionally the same as 'quisling' or
'bootlicker', from a different perspective.

### Homophobia
When used to describe the idea of trans acceptance, "homophobia" is code for "not being same-[sex](#biological-sex)-attraction exclusive".

### KPSS
"Keep Prisons Single Sex". Moral panic hashtag.

### Men
Can refer to cisgender men, or transgender women, with about equal probability.
In some cases it can even refer to cisgender women who they don't like, or transgender men that they're deeply confused by.

### Misogyny
When used to describe the idea of trans acceptance, "misogyny" is code for "not defining women by [biological sex](#biological-sex)".
Often *not* used to describe behavior such as making fun of women for their appearance (or "being on their knees for a man")

### Rapid-onset gender dysphoria (ROGD)
The conspiracy theory that kids are being brainwashed or peer pressured into identifying as trans. Thoroughly debunked in [ROGD](/library/gc-arguments/rogd).

### Self ID
The vague concept that anyone can determine, and insist that others must socially and legally agree to, their gender at any given
moment's notice. Often paired with moral panic around bathroom predators (which is a fabrication/exaggeration) e.g.
#NoToSelfID.

### TIM / TIF
"Trans-identified male" and "trans-identified female"--- terms that misgender and cram [biological sex](#biological-sex)
back into the way they talk about trans people.

### Tranny / Troon
Slurs that refer to transgender people.

### Transgender ideology / trans-rights activist (TRA)
The abstraction and dehumanization of transgender people into a belief system and activists that are easier to deride.

### "What is a woman?"
The gotcha question, and thought-terminating cliche, that GCs use whenever their definition of womanhood is challenged (or even
not explicitly validated.) The purpose of this question is two-fold:

1. To waste your time in a pointless debate, and to make you look foolish when you try to have a nuanced discussion with someone
   who has decided that a kindergarten-level understanding of gender is superior
2. To make you look foolish for not answering it, by making kindergarten-level taunts that amount to "because you can't".

This is also known as sealioning, because it presents itself as an invitation to good-faith discussion on its surface, but
rarely ever is.

### Women

The sex class whose definition gender-critical people seek to uphold, specifically the biologically
essentialist, colonial definition of women.

### Zippertits
Derogatory term for trans men, referring to mastectomy scars.
